# weather-App
Local Weather application using Vanilla Javascript.

Used Darksky weather API to fetch Local weather.

Used Skycons to display animation.
Hosted with github pages. https://yogeswarl.github.io/weather-App/
## Note:

Safari does not allow the javascript native geolocation tag to access location through http.

Used Cors-anywhere API to enable the calling and usage of API in localHost.
